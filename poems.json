Carrying all the pain, still smiling.\nYes, This is my job.\nIt’s always easy to say,\nYou carry my child and raise for so long.\nI did nothing, just gave a name and that’s all.\nIt’s always easy for you to say,\nYou make a living place home.\nYes, I know you do lot of things,\nThat why I try keep all my pain away so you can focus more.\nI do all dirty fight for you, so that you and our love ones can live more.\nYes you can say, I give just a name.\nBut I want people think before they try to harm you more.\nYes, I am Man. I don’t know.\nHow to say, It’s not easy to say I care, I care a lot.||"
